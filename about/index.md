In all its beauty, nature has never ceased to enchant humanity with its charm. For several millennia, humans have struggled to find the purpose of life. As human thinking evolved, so did their perspective on life. It all started in the Ethiopian and Egyptian grasslands 200,000 years ago, where the only thing that mattered was survival. As humans conquered the vast deserts of the Sahara, the deep Indian Ocean and the icy slopes of the Himalayas, they also conquered their minds. 

For many more years, our species spread out to the far-flung reaches of mother Earth, surviving the ice age through sheer resilience and intellect. It is our inherent curiosity to explore new places, our ability to adapt to the environment, our social nature to live with each other and cooperate as well as our quality to be ingenious with available resources, which differentiated us from our competitors in the animal kingdom. As more time went by, civilizations were formed and destroyed, wars were fought, divisions created, and we became our own worst enemies. 

The advent of the scientific revolution in the 16th and 17th century along with the mathematical quantification of universal laws and observations summoned a new chapter in the book of human history and culture. As technology progressed further, it brought with it the current age of globalization. 

We now find ourselves at the pinnacle of cutting edge technology and human growth. We have found sophisticated ways to interact, communicate and express ourselves, developed huge self-sustaining economies and created renewable sources of energy. However, deep inside, all of us still share the same seeds of curiosity, exploration, intellect and ingenuity which allowed our ancestors to survive in the vast African grasslands. We still use these powers, albeit not to hunt for food or find shelter, but to conquer our woes in modern life. These include studying, finding and working jobs, academic achievement, creative pursuits etc. And many of these woes are in fact more challenging than what our ancestors faced.

In striving daily, to attain that perfect life, we often forgo to live our lives the way we want. Tumbling in a constant spiral to achieve that perfect salary, or attaining the perfect score, or impressing the perfect man/woman, we often forget to enjoy our life to the fullest. Sometimes our emotions prevail, most of the times, our minds… 

It is thus important, to take a break from this mundane and dystopian life, and just revel in our thoughts. Let the mind be free. Explore our inner self and just surrender to the currents… The currents of the rivers of our thought. As they meander from one place to another, making us nothing but vagabonds. In this complex stream of thoughts, lies a feeling of peace and solace, which can be believed only when experienced first-hand.  

So whenever you feel, like everything is going south on you, just surrender… to your thoughts… and find that feeling… because it will revitalize you, to work hard in your real life. It is this very key, which has allowed our ancestors to thrive, when no one else could, and paved a way for our success today. 

>With this very feeling, I welcome you, to the journey to the centre of my mind, a lawless and tumultuous place, where long-winded rivers of thought meet, generate and create ideas. A beautiful amalgamation of the meandering rivers into the sea. A place where chaos is indeed beautiful..
