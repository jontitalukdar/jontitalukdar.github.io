## Professional Experience
***
### 1. Logic Technology Development (Q&R) Intern, Intel Corporation
*Radiation Effects Team (CQN), Technology Manufacturing Group, Hillsboro, OR*
* Wrote task scheduling algorithms for GPU memory optimization and parallel procesing.
* Developed artificially rendered synthetic datasets using Blender, achieving high photorealism for transfer learning. Also tested different data augmentation techniques for effective transfer learning.
* Performed hyperparameter optimization of state of the art deep convolutional neural networks like faster RCNN, SSD, R-FCN, GoogLeNet, DetectNet, etc. using Caffe and TensorFlow frameworks and increased overall mAP by more than 35%.

### 2. SoC Front-End & Architecture Intern, NXP Semiconductors
*Automotive Microprocessor Group, New Delhi, India*
* Part of a cross continental team actively contributing in SoC integration and Front end development for 16FFC based SoCs.
* Hands on experience in automated flow based techniques for rapid SoC integration as well as CDC, RDC and Lint based methodology signoffs using Synopsys Spyglass and Mentor Questa.
* Responsible for top level integration of several safety critical IP subsystems (IO Virtualization, System Integration Unit, FlexNoC/Platform) using automation flows including their clocking, reset and power connectivity as per ISO26262 and ASIL D standards.
* Handled CDC and RDC signoffs for DDR subsystem as well as carried out tool performance analysis (Questa) for the same, taking care of constraints and waiver conversion as well as rule mapping.
* Worked with SoC memory map based flow for front end integration.
* Performed RDC, CDC and Lint sanity checks for Automotive Radar SoC as part of 55nm technology node.
* Worked with enterprise level build management and project management tools including Enovia DesignSync, Design PDM, IBM DOORs.
* Handled detailed documentation flows like CRR for traceability from Architectural spec and requirements to detailed design technical specifications for IP Subsystems.
