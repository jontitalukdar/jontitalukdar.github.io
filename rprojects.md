### Deep learning applied to NLP and Vision

#### 1. Relation classification for biomedical text
*Bachelor Thesis Project under Prof. Ashish Anand, Dept. of CSE, IIT Guwahati*

* Devised and implemented a novel Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) model to learn long and short term dependencies
* Evaluated an attentive pooling strategy in comparison with conventional pooling methods
* Achieved state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets (i2b2 and DDI) without any need for manual feature engineering

#### 2. Identifying semantically equivalent questions
*Guide: Prof. Ashish Anand, Dept. of CSE, IIT Guwahati*

* Working on a novel technique to identify duplicate questions using a joint representation and a template-based approach
* Comparing with baselines involving feature-based classifiers, kernel-based pair-wise ranking, soft cosine similarity, and adversarial training
* Evaluation on the Quora dataset and a StackOverflow dataset

#### 3. Text readability analysis using language modeling
*Guide: Prof. Ashish Anand, Dept. of CSE, IIT Guwahati*

* Developed an unsupervised approach for predicting text readability scores using different language models
* Implemented statistical and deep-learning models, for comparing results with vocabulary-based and syntactic approaches

#### 4. Spatial transformer networks
*Guide: Prof. Arijit Sur, Dept. of CSE, IIT Guwahati*

* Used the STN module from [Jaderberg et al.](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5854-spatial-transformer-networks.pdf) (NIPS 2015) for object recognition and activity prediction from egocentric images
* Worked with GTEA and Intel Egocentric Vision data sets on Tensorflow

### Artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, and fuzzy theory

#### 1. Monitoring production line performance to reduce failures
*Guide: Prof. Rashmi Dutta Baruah, Dept. of CSE, IIT Guwahati*

* The objective was to model fault recognition as a classification problem consisting of very high-dimensional data containing thousands of instances
* Worked on feature selection using Gradient Boosting, and representation of categorical features by a single numeric feature using STG and RDA methods
* Also proposed a meta-optimization of the evaluation metric using Bayesian optimization, as a post-classification step

#### 2. Similarity analysis on multidimensional fuzzy sets
*Guide: Prof. Frank Chung-Hoon Rhee, Dept. of ECE, Hanyang University, Korea*

* Analyzed various multidimensional fuzzy membership functions and compared similarity of data sets using Wilcoxons nonparametric tests
* Established guidelines for selecting appropriate MFs based on data set and application requirements
* Recently extended the proposed method for high-dimensional data using dimensionality reduction approaches like PCA, kernel PCA, probabilistic PCA, and t-SNE

#### 3. Fuzzy adaptive resonance theory (ART) clustering
*Guide: Prof. Frank Chung-Hoon Rhee, Dept. of ECE, Hanyang University, Korea*

* Worked on improving clustering performance of fuzzy ART algorithm by integrating Interval Type-2 approach into vigilance parameter computation
* Obtained 5-10% better classification results compared to other methods

#### 4. Survey on probabilistic databases
*Guide: Prof. Amit Awekar, Dept. of CSE, IIT Guwahati, India*

* Reviewed existing work on probabilistic DBs, categorized into 5 major sections, namely algebra, query evaluation, conditioning, scaling and implementation
* Through a reevaluation of performance parameters, we showed that query evaluation is indeed the
bottleneck in efficient development and implementation of the probabilistic DBMS model

It has truly been said, that the only constant in life is change. Life is not a simple prose but a complex composition. Just like an elaborate and twisting plot, each and every stage in life presents us with a different predicament, an unsolvable dilemma. These junctures, where we make critical decisions, shape our future in a big way, whether we like it or not. It is in this context, that our life becomes nothing, but a complex web of decisions. It is the decisions we take through all our stages of life, right from our childhood to our old age, that define our life as a whole. These perplexing situations often come at critical junctures in our life, at a period of transition, from childhood to adolescence, from teenage to adulthood etc.


Hence, always keep a positive self-image of yourself, develop a sense of where you want to be, and keep a tab of your strengths and weaknesses. Most importantly, work to improve upon and remove those weak links. 

>After all, to maximize your chances of having a happy ending in this cruel composition of life, you need every possible advantage you can get.
