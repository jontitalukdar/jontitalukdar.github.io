## Focus: Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Deep Learning
 
### 1. Transfer Learning for Object Detection using state of the art Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
__**Research Internship, High Performance Computing Lab, IIT Gandhinagar; under Dr. Ravi Hegde**__
* Trained Deep Convolutional Neural Networks on synthetic images for the task of object detection using Nvidia GPUs like Titan X and GTX 1070.
* Wrote task scheduling algorithms for GPU memory optimization and parallel procesing.
* Developed artificially rendered synthetic datasets using Blender, achieving high photorealism for transfer learning. Also tested different data augmentation techniques for effective transfer learning.
* Performed hyperparameter optimization of state of the art deep convolutional neural networks like faster RCNN, SSD, R-FCN, GoogLeNet, DetectNet, etc. using Caffe and TensorFlow frameworks and increased overall mAP by more than 35%.

### 2. Real-time Human Action Recognition System
__**Funded R&D Project, IdeaLab Technology Incubator; under Dr. Tanish Zaveri**__
* Developed a novel approach for recognizing human actions using good features and iterative optical flow algorithm.
* Used the resilient backpropagation algorithm for training the feedforward neural network by utilizing OpenCV and Python based machine learning libraries including ‘sklearn’, ‘skimage’, etc.
* Implemented and tested the system on embedded Linux platforms including Odroid XU4, Raspberry Pi 3.

### Artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, and fuzzy theory

#### 1. Monitoring production line performance to reduce failures
*Guide: Prof. Rashmi Dutta Baruah, Dept. of CSE, IIT Guwahati*

* The objective was to model fault recognition as a classification problem consisting of very high-dimensional data containing thousands of instances
* Worked on feature selection using Gradient Boosting, and representation of categorical features by a single numeric feature using STG and RDA methods
* Also proposed a meta-optimization of the evaluation metric using Bayesian optimization, as a post-classification step

#### 2. Similarity analysis on multidimensional fuzzy sets
*Guide: Prof. Frank Chung-Hoon Rhee, Dept. of ECE, Hanyang University, Korea*

* Analyzed various multidimensional fuzzy membership functions and compared similarity of data sets using Wilcoxons nonparametric tests
* Established guidelines for selecting appropriate MFs based on data set and application requirements
* Recently extended the proposed method for high-dimensional data using dimensionality reduction approaches like PCA, kernel PCA, probabilistic PCA, and t-SNE

#### 3. Fuzzy adaptive resonance theory (ART) clustering
*Guide: Prof. Frank Chung-Hoon Rhee, Dept. of ECE, Hanyang University, Korea*

* Worked on improving clustering performance of fuzzy ART algorithm by integrating Interval Type-2 approach into vigilance parameter computation
* Obtained 5-10% better classification results compared to other methods

#### 4. Survey on probabilistic databases
*Guide: Prof. Amit Awekar, Dept. of CSE, IIT Guwahati, India*

* Reviewed existing work on probabilistic DBs, categorized into 5 major sections, namely algebra, query evaluation, conditioning, scaling and implementation
* Through a reevaluation of performance parameters, we showed that query evaluation is indeed the
bottleneck in efficient development and implementation of the probabilistic DBMS model

It has truly been said, that the only constant in life is change. Life is not a simple prose but a complex composition. Just like an elaborate and twisting plot, each and every stage in life presents us with a different predicament, an unsolvable dilemma. These junctures, where we make critical decisions, shape our future in a big way, whether we like it or not. It is in this context, that our life becomes nothing, but a complex web of decisions. It is the decisions we take through all our stages of life, right from our childhood to our old age, that define our life as a whole. These perplexing situations often come at critical junctures in our life, at a period of transition, from childhood to adolescence, from teenage to adulthood etc.


Hence, always keep a positive self-image of yourself, develop a sense of where you want to be, and keep a tab of your strengths and weaknesses. Most importantly, work to improve upon and remove those weak links. 

>After all, to maximize your chances of having a happy ending in this cruel composition of life, you need every possible advantage you can get.
